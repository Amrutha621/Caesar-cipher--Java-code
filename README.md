# Caesar-cipher--Java-code
##Caesar cipher is one of the simplest and earliest encryption techniques, where each letter in the plaintext is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3, A becomes D, B becomes E, and so on. Though easy to understand and implement, it is highly insecure and can be broken using simple frequency analysis.
